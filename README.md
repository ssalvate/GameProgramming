# Game Programming with C++

Game Programming in C++; Studies + exercises from book of the same name by Sanjay Madhav 

## Description

A long-term project that I am using to strengthen and reinforce my game programming fundamentals.
I am also attempting to better document the projects I do for personal growth.
This project starts with fundamental concepts of game programming in 2D and moves into 3D.
Mini demo projects are written to demonstrate the fundamentals learned.

## Current progress

* Pong - Core real-time game concepts
    * Game Loop
    * Game Updating over time
    * Game input and output
    
* Side Scroller - Game object representation + 2D grahics techniques
    * Game objects representation models, implement Actor and Component system
    * Sprites
    * Sprite animations
    * Scrolling backgrounds
    * Tilemaps
    
* Asteroids - Vectors and Basic Physics
    * Vector math: Vectors and how they are used in games
    * Basics of Newtonian physics
    * Basic movement        - Move Component
    * Basic keyboard input  - Input Component
    * Collision detection   - Circle Component

### Dependencies (based on progress)

* SDL + SDL_image
* Windows 10
