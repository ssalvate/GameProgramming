# Game Programming with C++

Game Programming in C++; Studies + exercises from book of the same name by Sanjay Madhav 

## Description

A long-term project that I am using to strengthen and reinforce my game programming fundamentals.
I am also attempting to better document the projects I do for personal growth.
This project starts with fundamental concepts of game programming in 2D and moves into 3D.
Mini demo projects are written to demonstrate the fundamentals learned.
